# Minimal MUI MCP

Minimal is a component-level Model Context Package (MCP)
for building enterprise-grade UIs with Material UI.

## Contents

- /skills — UI component skills (structure & intent)
- /theme — Reference MUI theme (visual layer)

## How it works

- MCP skills generate layout and component intent
- MUI theme applies spacing, typography, and visuals

## Notes

The theme is optional.
Any compatible MUI theme can be used instead.
